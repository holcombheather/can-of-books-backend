## Overview
Can of Books is a book tracking app that allows users to keep track of the books they have read, the ones that have impacted them, and books that are recommended for them to read next. The problem domain is providing a platform for book lovers to manage and organize their reading lists, and to discover new books based on recommendations from other users. The app aims to help users keep track of their reading progress, reflect on the impact of books they have read, and facilitate the discovery of new books to enrich their reading experience. The motivation behind building this app is to encourage reading, promote literacy, and foster a community of book enthusiasts.

## Getting Started

Here is a high-level overview of the steps to get started with the book tracking app:

* Install Node.js and npm on your machine
* Clone the front-end and back-end repositories for the app from GitHub
* Install the necessary dependencies for both repositories using npm
* Set up a MongoDB Atlas account and create a new database
* Create a `.env` file in the back-end repository and add your MongoDB connection string
* Update the `API_URL` constant in the front-end repository to point to your deployed back-end API
* Start the back-end server using `npm start` in the back-end repository
* Start the front-end development server using `npm start` in the front-end repository
* Access the front-end app in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`

Note that these steps assume that you already have Git installed on your machine. If you do not, you will need to install Git before you can clone the repositories from GitHub.
